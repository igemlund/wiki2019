<p class="ingress" >Welcome to our Project Description. This is what we in iGEM Lund set out to accomplish in the beginning of our project. Our quite ambitious plan, to remidy toxic metal exposure, described below was made into reailty, with a few adjustements. If you want to know our design, head over to our <a href="/Team:Lund/Design">project design!</a> </p>

<h2 id="the problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>Despite the growth that the field of agriculture has achieved alongside groundbreaking technological advancement, global farmers and producers are forced to rely on primitive and economically deficient methods to solve a problem that has plagued them for centuries. Phytophthora infestans, or otherwise known as Potato Late Blight disease, has been unrivaled at threatening the putrification of potato crops since the eighteenth century. The current method to solving this problem involves heavily using fungicides to prevent the disease. It has proved to be effective at treating the problem but comes at an alarmingly high cost. In the U.S it was estimated that the annual costs for fungicides are $77.1 million. It doesn’t stop there, however, as U.S growers suffer an additional $210.7 million in lost revenues (J.F. GUENTHNER et al., 2001, The economic impact of potato late blight on US growers). Potato Late Blight is even more pertinent across Europe. In Sweden for instance, Potatoes account for 2% of swedish crop area, but for 21% of pesticide usage Phytophthora infestans. Not only is using pesticides economically detrimental, but it also has environmentally harmful implications. Exposure to pesticides is potentially a serious health hazard. Pesticides have been linked to world-wide deaths and chronic diseases, as well as the destruction of several plant and animal habitats (Md. Wasim Aktar et al, 2009, Impact of pesticides use in agriculture: their benefits and hazards). Due to all these implications, there is an ever-growing need for a sustainable and efficient solution.

<p>TMs exist in several forms; organic, inorganic and ions, each have different characteristics. A common trait amongst them is the ability to bioaccumulate and disrupt metabolic activities by mimicking the structure of other compounds such as phosphates and amino acids [4]. Therefore, TM poisoning has severe implications on the human body. TM-poisoning is treated with chelation therapy, a last resort-treatment with several gruesome side effects. We saw a need for a viable and sustainable way of reducing the amount of TM-poisoning worldwide.

<p class="fig"></p>
<p>The three most common, widespread and troublesome TMs are arsenic, lead and mercury - each contributing to TM-poisoning in major parts of the world [5]. Being the health-freaks that we are in Sweden, you often hear about the dangers of TMs in your daily lives: “wash your rice eight times before cooking it to get rid of the arsenic”, “only eat fish once a week or you’ll get mercury poisoning”. Therefore, we started looking into ways of dealing with TM-contamination and poisoning.

<h2 id="Inspiration">Inspiration</h2>
<p>In 2015, the Taiwanese iGEM team NYMU Taipei, attempted to cure Potato Late Blight by producing an antimicrobial peptide, plant defensin. Their approach, nevertheless, managed to curtail the level of infection caused by the disease but not fully eliminate it. This compelled us to build on their approach and take it a few levels further.
    Since one antimicrobial peptide was able to reduce the level of the fungicide, we decided to try to make a mixture of several antimicrobial peptides and produce them through harmless synthetic bacteria in order to combat this disease.
    
</p>
<p>We realized how extensive a filtration system would have to be if it were to be implemented in bodies of water in means of reducing the amounts of TMs before entering the human body, and therefore dismissed the idea. Instead, through conversation with experts we decided to focus on preventing TM-poisoning by bioaccumulation through synthetic probiotic bacteria.
</p>
<h2 id="Our Goal">Our Goal</h2>
<p>Plants have been exposed to fungicides for millions of years, and ergo, some have developed different ways of fighting them through certain antimicrobial peptides. by combining different antimicrobial peptides and forming them into a cocktail, the end result would provide a more durable structure over time. A two-plasmid system allows for use of a fusion partner without needing to add separate protease to cleave the fusion protein. This, in turn, allows for an efficient and sustainable system. Our main goal is to be able to release this product into the environment and help put an end to Phytophthora. Hence, an optically regulated (optogenetic) kill switch was incorporated to our project design to make the future of GMOs possible. Not only that, but our project also lays ground for the development of sustainable pesticide alternatives.

<p class="fig"></p>
<p>As our engineered bacteria is ingested it will adapt to the gut microbiome, absorb and accumulate TMs, to later be excreted through faeces, returning the TMs to the earth. In the earth the bacteria will cause no harm, in fact, it will most likely die due to it's lessened survival as it's wasting energy on creating our overexpressed proteins. It will be a preventative measure implemented in probiotic products to reduce the extent of TM-poisoning across the globe. Our product also lay ground for the development of filters to be used in bodies of water and elsewhere.
