<p class="ingress">Throughout our project we've received support from a number of people and entities. Without this support, the project would not have been possible. We are very grateful to the following people and entities!</p>
<h2 id="LTH">Counseling from the staff at Lund University</h2>
<br>
<div id="content">
<p><strong>N&eacute;lida Leiva Eriksson&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>For supporting us with wisdom, and motivation. She helped us out in the first phase of the project as one of our PI’s. We’d like to thank her for her time with us as we miss having her be part of the project. 
</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Johan Svensson Bonde, Researcher at the Department of Pure and Applied Biochemistry&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>For helping us in many ways and teaching us hard lessons about the importance of experimental replicates. For giving us time out of his schedule to answer our questions and give us advice. Thank you!</p><br>

<p><strong>NYMU Taipei 2015</strong></p>
<p>This team made us aware of the pesticidal quality of antimicrobial peptides in the first place. They had a really exciting project and if you are interested in other ways of looking at this problem, go have a look!</p><br>
<br>
<p><strong>Maja Brus-Szkalej, Phd at SLU</strong></p>
<p>We have had a lot of correspondence with Maja throughout the year. Through e-mails, meetings, sending articles and her own work, she helped us understand the modern aspects of the problem so much better. She allowed us to ask whatever questions we had, and couldn’t have been more gracious in her responses. She even offered us to, in the case that we were able to get expression during the summer despite the circumstances, conduct growth assays at SLU under her supervision. Thank you so much Maja!
</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Björn Anderson</strong></p>
<p>After contacting researchers at SLU, they referred us to Björn Andersson, a scientist working with plant pathology and who has a lot of knowledge regarding P. infestans. Through an online meeting, Björn gave us great insights into how it is to work with the pathogen, how it affects the agriculture of potatoes and how it is dealt with. Thank you Björn for your insights!
</p>
<br>
<p><strong>SynthEthics</strong></p>
<p>We had a lot of our public engagement activities and initiatives through SynthEthics.</p><br>

<p><strong>Arvid Larson:</strong></p>
<p>Gave us tips and advice on modeling and web development.</p><br>
<p><strong>Savvina L. and Mateusz S. </strong></p>
<p>Our advisors, who helped us during the whole project.</p><br>

<p><strong>I-Tasser Zhang Lab</strong></p>
<p>We used the Zhang Labs model to predict the structures of the peptides generated by STAAC. </p><br>

<p><strong>Gränsbo Potatis</strong></p>
<p>FWe wanted to meet people that would be the first hand implementers of our product, and Ulf and Edna at Gränsbo Potatis let us visit them at their fields. They gave us insights on their thoughts on the pathogen, treatments and strategies to avoid infection, we discussed GMO and they showed us how to detect the disease. Thank you Ulf and Edna!</p><br>

<p><strong>Other iGEM Teams we talked to</strong></p>
<p> iGEM Linkoping, Copenhagen, Chalmers, Ohio, and Stockholm.
</p><br>
<p><strong>Liselotte Andersson, Purchasing Coordinator at Pure and Applied Biochemistry at LTH</strong></p>
<p>For helping us order lab equipment.</p><br>
<p>People who helped with the project during its early phase and development: Magnus Axen and Mathias Duedahl.</p>

<h2 id="resources">Resources and Financial Support</h2>
<p>Thank you to all our sponsors for believing in our project.</p><br>
<p><strong>LTH</strong></p>
